## Problem Statement Analysis

### Original Problem (from Assignment3.txt)
> "Delivery failures and delays are one of the biggest drivers of customer dissatisfaction and revenue leakage in logistics. While current systems can report on how many deliveries failed, they provide little clarity on why they failed."

### DFRAS Solution Approach

#### 1. **Aggregate Multi-Domain Data** ✅
- **Orders**: Complete order lifecycle tracking
- **Fleet Logs**: Driver performance and GPS tracking
- **Warehouse Data**: Picking times and dispatch logs
- **Customer Feedback**: Complaints and satisfaction scores
- **External Context**: Weather, traffic, and event data

#### 2. **Correlate Events Automatically** ✅
- **Temporal Correlation**: Links events across time windows
- **Spatial Correlation**: Identifies location-based patterns
- **Causal Analysis**: Recognizes cause-and-effect relationships
- **Pattern Detection**: Uses ML algorithms for recurring patterns

#### 3. **Generate Human-Readable Insights** ✅
- **Narrative Explanations**: Plain English instead of raw dashboards
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for insights
- **Quantitative Evidence**: Statistical support for each insight
- **Role-Based Reports**: Customized for different user roles

#### 4. **Surface Actionable Recommendations** ✅
- **Specific Steps**: Clear, implementable recommendations
- **Priority Ranking**: Prioritizes by impact and feasibility
- **Implementation Guidance**: Resources, timelines, and cost-benefit analysis
- **Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitors implementation and results
