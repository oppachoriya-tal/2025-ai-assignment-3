## Problem Statement Analysis

### Current Challenges in Delivery Operations

The logistics industry faces significant challenges in understanding delivery failures:

1. **Fragmented Data Sources**: Order logs, fleet reports, warehouse records, and customer complaints exist in siloed systems
2. **Manual Investigation Process**: Operations managers must manually correlate data across multiple systems
3. **Reactive Approach**: Issues are addressed only after failures occur
4. **Limited Context**: External factors (weather, traffic, events) are not integrated into analysis
5. **Unstructured Information**: Customer feedback and driver notes are not systematically analyzed

### Business Impact

- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Delivery failures are major drivers of customer complaints
- **Revenue Leakage**: Failed deliveries result in financial losses and operational inefficiencies
