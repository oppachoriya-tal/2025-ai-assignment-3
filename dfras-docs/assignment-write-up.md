# DFRAS: Delivery Failure Root Cause Analysis System

## Problem Statement

Delivery failures and delays are one of the biggest drivers of customer dissatisfaction and revenue leakage in logistics. While current systems can report on how many deliveries failed, they provide little clarity on why they failed. Operations managers must manually investigate across siloed systems — order logs, fleet reports, warehouse records, and customer complaints — making the process reactive, time-consuming, and error-prone.

### Key Challenges:

- **Fragmented Data Sources**: Order & shipment data, fleet & driver logs, warehouse data, customer feedback, and contextual data (traffic, weather) exist in separate silos
- **Lack of Correlation**: No systematic way to link events across different data sources (e.g., traffic spikes with late deliveries)
- **Unstructured Information**: Driver notes and customer complaints are unstructured and difficult to analyze
- **Reactive Analysis**: Current systems only report failures after they occur, not predict or prevent them
- **Manual Investigation**: Operations managers must manually correlate data across multiple systems

### Strategic Need:

The company needs a system that can:
1. **Aggregate Multi-Domain Data** — orders, fleet logs, warehouse dispatch times, external conditions, and customer complaints
2. **Correlate Events Automatically** — link traffic spikes with late deliveries or stockouts with order cancellations
3. **Generate Human-Readable Insights** — provide narrative explanations instead of raw dashboards
4. **Surface Actionable Recommendations** — suggest operational changes (e.g., rescheduling, staffing adjustments, address verification)

## Solution Overview

DFRAS (Delivery Failure Root Cause Analysis System) is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that addresses the fragmented logistics data challenge by providing intelligent root cause analysis and predictive insights.

### Core Solution Components:

1. **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Unified data pipeline that aggregates data from orders, fleet logs, warehouse records, customer feedback, and external factors
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: LLM-based natural language processing to extract insights from unstructured data
3. **Automated Correlation Engine**: Machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations across data sources
4. **Intelligent Reporting**: Human-readable insights and actionable recommendations
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Proactive failure prediction and mitigation strategies

## LLM Model and Implementation

### Model Used: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence Transformer)

**Why this model?**
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight model suitable for real-time processing
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles diverse text inputs from drivers and customers
- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning beyond keyword matching
- **Embedding Generation**: Converts unstructured text into numerical vectors for analysis

### How LLM is Used:

1. **Text Embedding Generation**:
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   
   # Convert unstructured text to embeddings
   driver_notes_embeddings = model.encode(driver_notes)
   customer_feedback_embeddings = model.encode(customer_feedback)
   ```

2. **Semantic Similarity Analysis**:
   - Compare driver notes with known failure patterns
   - Cluster similar customer complaints
   - Identify recurring themes in unstructured data

3. **Natural Language Query Processing**:
   - Convert business questions into structured queries
   - Generate human-readable explanations
   - Provide contextual insights

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identify failure patterns from historical data
   - Correlate external factors with delivery outcomes
   - Generate predictive models
